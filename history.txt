Here's a little review of your decisions: 


You want to make scrambled eggs this morning.

Do you...

Success! The eggs are super fluffy and delicious. You are full and ready
for the day.

You got tied up in a conversation with your friend arguing about the
merits of your recipe vs Gordon's. As a result you spent $15 on a lame 
breakfast at the café, because you had no time to cook.
